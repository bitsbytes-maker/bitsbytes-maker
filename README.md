Hi there, I'm Maloy Kumar Devnath! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a doctoral student in Information Systems Department at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, where I work in the Mobile, Pervasive, and Sensor Computing Lab. My research focuses on using mmWave radar sensors in smart home systems and autonomous detection systems, as well as developing inter-communication platforms for executing DL models across multiple computational nodes. 

In addition to my academic work, I also have experience in the security domain, where I suggested utilizing a Graph-Based Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm to improve a CAN Bus Intrusion Detection System. Before pursuing my PhD, I worked as a C++ software engineer at Codecrafters International Limited, where I helped develop large-scale portfolio management and credit analysis software applications used by major companies like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America.

I was also an Assistant Professor at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Science & Technology University, Gopalganj, where I taught and mentored students in Computer Science. I love sharing my knowledge and helping others learn, and I am always looking for new opportunities to engage with the broader tech community.

When I'm not working, you can usually find me playing video games, reading sci-fi novels, or spending time with my family and friends. I'm a big fan of open-source software and enjoy contributing to various projects on GitHub, so feel free to check out my repositories and reach out if you're interested in collaborating!

Thanks for stopping by, and I look forward to connecting with you through my email (maloyd1@umbc.edu)! ðŸ˜Š
